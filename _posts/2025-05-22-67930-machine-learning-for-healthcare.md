title: '6.7930: Machine Learning for Healthcare'
---

We learned about machine learning applications in healthcare. Our project was on early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, with a focus on explainability.

From the course catalog: Introduces students to machine learning in healthcare, including the nature of clinical data and the use of machine learning for risk stratification, disease progression modeling, precision medicine, diagnosis, subtype discovery, and improving clinical workflows. Topics include causality, interpretability, algorithmic fairness, time-series analysis, graphical models, deep learning and transfer learning. Guest lectures by clinicians from the Boston area, and projects with real clinical data, emphasize subtleties of working with clinical data and translating machine learning into clinical practice.
