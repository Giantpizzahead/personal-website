Hi! I'm Kyle Fu, a passionate MIT student looking to change the world using the latest breakthroughs in computer science.

During my time at Homestead High School, I helped lead our programming club, discovering the competitive programming community in the process. On my road to becoming a two-time [USA Computing Olympiad finalist](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=finalists21), I saw the vast potential of technology unfold. The bursts of joy I get from solving a complex problem, seeing my name near the top of the leaderboards, and seeing others solve the problems I created motivate me to keep coding, to strive to be a better version of myself.

Computer science is my passion. I’ve spent countless hours tinkering with computers and creating fun projects. I've achieved strong results in [CTF competitions](https://github.com/Giantpizzahead/ctf-archive), and explored the human side of computing through the [Google IT Support certificate program](https://coursera.org/share/3a5adcb9128aa8bea5b79e02ef0d56ad). My love for the analytical thinking that comes with problem solving drives me on. I envision my future self as a computer scientist in a medical lab, helping researchers find new ways to treat diseases. I might even be in a computer lab, researching future generations of computing.

Apart from computing, music is everywhere in my life, from the lo-fi hip hop tunes playing while I finish homework to the dubstep songs in rhythm games. ([Porter Robinson <3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMc-4GsuXJc&t=5635s))
<br>
No matter what I’m doing, chances are I’ll have music playing. Music is a universal language, a way to express feelings that everyone understands; just a few heartfelt notes can calm me down or motivate me to take a giant leap.

I express myself through music by playing and making custom levels in rhythm games. In one such video game - Geometry Dash - I created [easier versions of the hardest levels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM2dwb0GnkA). This way, players could enjoy the song and beautiful design of the original level, without having to practice the same level for hours on end. The nostalgia and calm I feel from playing these levels make the time spent well worth it. The knowledge I’ve gained from music composition classes has also allowed me to produce and publish my own songs and melodies. By creating [my own parody rhythm game](https://all-things-web.herokuapp.com/Just%20JS%20and%20Beats/index.html) using these songs, I’m able to bring my music to life.

On a more casual note: If I'm not grinding schoolwork, you'll probably find me binging random YouTube videos, like drama compilations, programming language tutorials, or multiplayer Minecraft playthroughs. I could rewatch shows like Star Trek: Voyager and Arcane for days. I play tennis (badly), and occasionally poke people with sticks - aka fencing. I like gaming with friends too - League of Legends anyone? no? ok - but I'm kinda trash ngl.

I aspire to help people around the world (like you!), to give everyone the chance to write their own stories, the way they want to tell them.
<br>
And I believe technology has the potential to make that happen.
